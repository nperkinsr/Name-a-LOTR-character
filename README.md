# Name a LOTR character
This is a small project made to practise checking if a specific value exists within an array. Users are prompted to input the name of a character from The _Lord of the Rings_ and click the **Check** button. The script will then verify if the entered name matches any of the characters in the predefined array.

If the character exists, the app displays a positive message; if not, it gives a wrong message.

This project is a good way to practise working with arrays, conditionals, and basic user interaction.
